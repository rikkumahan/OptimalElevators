## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- Command line interface

### Installation & Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rikkumahan/OptimalElevators.git
cd OptimalElevators

javac ElevatorSystem.java
java ElevatorSystem
```

### Usage
1. **Configure System**: Enter number of floors and elevators
2. **Make Hall Calls**: Enter floor + direction (e.g., `6U` for floor 6 going up, `3D` for floor 3 going down)
3. **Monitor Status**: Type `status` to see elevator positions
4. **Exit**: Type `exit` to terminate

### Example Session
```
Enter the no.of Floors : 20
Enter the no.of Elevators : 4
Input Hall calls here in the format (6U / 6D).
4U
Hall call received at floor 4U (time -> 7 s)
car2 assigned to floor 4
Elevator car2 reached 4 at 12 sec.[Arrived floor 4 in 1 sec]
Passenger inside Elevator car2 pressed 12
1D
Hall call received at floor 1D (time -> 23 s)
car1 assigned to floor 1
Elevator car2 reached 12 at 24 sec.[Arrived floor 12 in 9 sec]
Elevator car1 reached 1 at 28 sec.[Arrived floor 1 in 1 sec]
Passenger inside Elevator car1 pressed 0
Elevator car1 reached 0 at 33 sec.[Arrived floor 0 in 2 sec]
status
Current state of car1 is 0I
Current state of car2 is 12I
Current state of car3 is 10I
Current state of car4 is 15I
exit

```

double Tf = 1;           // Inter-floor travel time (seconds)
double Ts = 4;           // Stop duration (seconds)
```
